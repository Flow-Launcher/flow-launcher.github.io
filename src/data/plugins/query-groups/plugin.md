A plugin that lets you organize queries into groups for quick access.

## Features
- **Create named query groups** - Organize related search queries together
- **Easy management** - Intuitive interface for adding, editing, and removing groups and their queries.
- **Save complex queries** - Save long queries, under a group and a short display name.
- **Quick access** - Search groups by name or browse all available groups


## Usage

Query Groups can be managed in two places:
- **The Settings page** (useful for bulk or structured edits)
- **The Flow Launcher search interface** (faster and more intuitive for day-to-day use)

### Managing via Search (recommended)

Typing ``qg`` lists your existing query groups and includes an option to add a new one.
Any groups you create will show up in the default search as well.

- Selecting a **group** shows the queries it contains, along with an option to add another.
- Selecting a **query** item replaces the current input with its stored query. 

- Right-click a **group** to rename or delete it.
- Right-click a **query** to rename it, change its query, or delete it.

### Managing via Settings

Groups and queries can also be created and edited from Flow Launcher's Settings under Plugins -> Query Groups.
